          I've had friends describe me as an equal mix computer geek and grizzly adams.  As I self-refelct, I have to admit that it a very apt description of me. My carrier, to date, shows this, as I've worked as an outdoor wilderness counselor for troubled youth, kayak salesman/guide for two different kayak manufacturers out in Seattle, but have also spent time in the ISP world, configring routers and setting up VOIP networks for customers, planned and configured Wide Area NetWorks and for the last several years worked as a SDET, testing releases and wrting backend python scripts.

          My hobbies include paddling kayaks, canoes and stand up paddle boards.  And before dealign with adult onset seaizures, I flew Cessna 150s and was a certified scuba diver. Over the past 4 or 5 years I have transitioned from a tent camping to hammock camping.  I also spend a fair amount of time taking coruses on Udemy dealing with technology (thinkg programming, AWS, Selenium and various Automation FrameWorks)

          The one soap box I tend to stand on and get my preach on is around the Ketogenic/Intermittent Fasting lifestyle.  To put it simply, Keto has not only changed my life, it has helped me regain my life back.  While it has been great dropping 50 lbs due to this lifestyle, it's the impact it has had on my seizures and motor tic that has made me a convert.
